Multiply the 'Before' ratio by 2 -> 8:2. Now compare the duck units. They changed from 2 to 1. This decrease of 1 unit represents the 12 ducks sold. So 1 unit = 12. The number of chickens is 8 units, so 8 × 12 = 96. My example was flawed, let's try another. The ratio of chickens to ducks on a farm was 2:3. After 10 chickens were added, the ratio became 3:2. How many ducks were there? Unchanged: Ducks. Before -> C:D = 2:3. After -> C:D = 3:2. LCM of 3 and 2 is 6. Before -> 4:6. After -> 9:6.
