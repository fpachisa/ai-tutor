# HomeCampus AI Tutor

This project is a proof-of-concept PSLE mathematics coach powered by Gemini and served with a minimal Flask backend.

## Running Locally

1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Start the Flask API:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Open `frontend/index.html` in a modern browser.

The interface has been restyled to better match the [HomeCampus](https://my.homecampus.com.sg) branding.
